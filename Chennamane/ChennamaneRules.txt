Chennamanne
Chennemane is the traditional board game from India which is played by two Players. More details at http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/chennemane-is-a-symbol-of-tulu-culture-and-heritage/article3678198.ece

RULES:

The first player picks up the seeds of one of his holes and distributes them into the following holes one by one anti-clockwise.
After dropping the last seed into a hole, the contents of the following hole are distributed in another lap.
The move ends when the following hole is empty. This is called "saada".
If the hole is empty, the player captures the contents of the succeeding hole. "In addition, he captures the contents of the hole opposite to that hole."
Each turn a player may move twice, if he captures in his first move. Then his term ends after two "saadas".
A player must move unless he has nothing to play with.
The game is finished when all counters are taken.
The player who has collected most counters wins the game.
In the next round, each player tries to fill his holes with five counters from his winnings. These holes which cannot be filled are marked with a pebble or a twig and are avoided for further play.
The match is continued until one player is unable to fill even one hole.
